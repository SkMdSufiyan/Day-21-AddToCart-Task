# Day-21-AddToCart-Task
Kindly check "App.js", "App.css", "productDetails.json" files to verify the code.   
The "App.js" is the main file and hold all the react-code.   
The App.css" holds all the css.   
The "productDetails.json" holds the data of all the products (taken 12 products' data).   
All the questions are implemented.   
But for displaying the rating of products, instead of showing the stars the actual value is shown by mentioning the scale.    
Whenever a particular product is added to the cart, then the cart count increases and the button now changes to "Remove from cart" button.   
Whenever the already added product is removed from the cart then the cart count decreases and the button is again set to "Add to cart" button.
